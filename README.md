# FiddlingWithEncryption
Just trying out the AES, Salts and Hashes and good design patterns in this console application that wants to have the following feature:

1. Connect to a user by asking for a login and a password;
2. Login onto a user;
3. display secret; (for logged in users only)
4. change secret; (for logged in users only)

Need to add some unit testing around library and program.
